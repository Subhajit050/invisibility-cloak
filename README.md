# invisibility-cloak
It is a opencv program which makes red coloured objects invisible, so if u put on a red colour cloak it will act as an invisible cloak
Being a harry potter fan I always had a childhood fantasy of using an invisibility cloak. Well it turns out that using simple image processing tricks I can now actually fulfil my childhood fantasy. This code turns a red colour cloth into an invisibility cloak. It's a fun application which you will enjoy using. You can learn some key functions of opencv from this project.
